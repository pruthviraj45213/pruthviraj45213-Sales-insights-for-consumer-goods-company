### Key Project Steps
1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**: We started by understanding the business need for insights related to sales trends in the consumer goods segment, specifically AtliQ hardware.
2. **Project Planning**: After gathering initial requirements, we outlined the necessary steps, tools, and methodologies for tackling the project.
3. **Data Discovery**: We identified the relevant data sources and gathered raw sales data for analysis.
4. **Data Analysis (SQL)**: We performed initial analysis using **SQL** to query the database, identify trends, and extract key metrics that would be relevant to the business.
5. **Data Cleaning & ETL**: We cleaned the data and performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks to ensure the data was structured properly for visualization.
6. **Building Dashboards (Power BI)**: Using **Power BI**, we created dynamic dashboards to display the sales trends effectively, ensuring that key metrics were easily accessible.
7. **Feedback & Iteration**: After deploying the initial dashboard, we gathered feedback from stakeholders and users to refine the dashboard, improving its layout, functionality, and presentation.
8. **Corporate Style Version 2.0**: Based on user feedback, we released Version 2.0 of the dashboard, which adhered to corporate styling guidelines, making the dashboard more aligned with the company's branding.

## Project Goal
The goal was to create an insightful dashboard that displayed sales trends for AtliQ hardware products, allowing decision-makers to:
- Gain a deeper understanding of sales performance.
- Identify areas for improvement and growth opportunities.
- Make data-driven decisions to boost revenue.

The dashboard aimed to contribute at least a **7% revenue increase** in the next quarter by providing actionable insights.

## Key Technologies & Tools
- **SQL**: Used for querying and analyzing raw sales data.
- **Power BI**: Used for building interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Data cleaning and transformation process to ensure the data was in the correct format for analysis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Requirement Gathering**: 
   - Gathered business requirements from key stakeholders.
   - Defined the scope of the dashboard, including the data points, metrics, and KPIs that would be displayed.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Retrieved data from multiple sources, focusing on sales performance, trends, and historical data for AtliQ hardware products.

3. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**:
   - Cleaned and transformed raw data to remove inconsistencies and ensure accuracy.
   - Ensured all necessary fields were available for analysis (e.g., sales amounts, regions, time periods).

4. **Data Modeling & Analysis**:
   - Performed initial analysis using SQL to identify key sales trends.
   - Created data models that reflected the relationships between sales data and key performance metrics.

5. **Building Dashboards in Power BI**:
   - Created an interactive Power BI dashboard that displayed the sales trends of AtliQ hardware products.
   - Visualizations included charts, graphs, and tables to present trends, categories, and other insights.
